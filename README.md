# ArbyScan
An arbitrage scanner for Poloniex, Bittrex and Binance cryptocurrency exchanges. It compares the values of currencies on these exchanges and notifies you of large percentage differences. This allows you to buy low on one exchange and sell high on another.
## Installation
You'll need to download some Python libraries before being able to run this script. Note that I ran this on Ubuntu.
```
Download https://github.com/ndri/python-bittrex to folder
pip install https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex/archive/v0.4.6.zip
pip install python-binance
apt-get install python-tk
```
